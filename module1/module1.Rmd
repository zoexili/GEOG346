`lx346` is the package I am developing for geog 346 coursework.

It currently has three functions, `my_number_checker`, which is executed as follows:

```{r}
library(lx346)
my_number_checker(1)
my_number_checker(10)
my_number_checker(20)
```

`squirrel_function` is executed as follows:

```{r}
library(lx346)
squirrel_function()
```

`fahrenheit2Celsius` is executed as follows:

```{r}
library(lx346)
fahrenheit2Celsius(30)
fahrenheit2Celsius(60)
fahrenheit2Celsius(90)
```

I will be adding other functions and update this vignette as we go.
